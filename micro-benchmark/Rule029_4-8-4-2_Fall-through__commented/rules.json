Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically // fall through). This special comment is not required in the last statement group of the switch block. Example:\n\nswitch (input) {\ncase 1:\ncase 2:\nprepareOneOrTwo();\n// fall through\ncase 3:\nhandleOneTwoOrThree();\nbreak;\ndefault:\nhandleLargeNumber(input);\n}\nNotice that no comment is needed after case 1:, only at the end of the statement group.",
